# CostKdecomp
An optimal cost-based algorithm (cost-k-decomp) for optimal hypertree decompositions inspired by https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1055558.1055587

For details see my PhD thesis https://scholar.google.it/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=it&user=icnAjqQAAAAJ&citation_for_view=icnAjqQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC

Please note that I've developed a simple python script which wraps the main algorithm to allow for an easier usage.
